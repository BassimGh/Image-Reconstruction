# Image-Reconstruction
Genetic Algorithm reconstructs any input image from ellipses

## How does it work?

1. Every pixel of the original image is scanned and each unique color is stored into a color array
2. The genetic algorithm begins with one ellipse and adds an ellipse at each generation

Fitness is calculated based on the produced image's similarity to the original
